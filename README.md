# Machine_Learning

VEX, a worldwide robotics competition, was a huge inspiration to me in my high school life, a major turning point in my decision to study in Electrical Engineering. 

In this project, using Python, I created a system that can recognize the VEX 2021-2021 Season Change Up Ball using a camera. The system can determine the ball's position relative to the camera and its movement relative to the camera. With my knowledge from image labeling, machine learning, python, and resources such as Colab, YOLOv3, and many other, I was able to pull this all together. 

The main theme of VEX had always been about creation and innovation, and I've successfully demonstrated such ability with my past knowledge in coding and resources online. Hope anyone who saw this would be able to create and innovate your own thing as well, regardless of whether it is a robot, machine, website, or anything of your own choice.
