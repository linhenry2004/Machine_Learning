# Machine_Learning

Robotics, a worldwide robotics competition, a huge inspiration to me in my high school life, a major turning point in my decision to study in Electrical Engineering. 

In this project, I will use Python to create a system for factory-setting robots. The system can determine the ball's position relative to the camera. Then, the system will calculate the distance from the camera to the object, and the object's movement relative to the camera. This system also considers what happens when parts of the sensors are broken. It is able to detect, report, and shut down broken sensors. Then, it uses algorithms to estimate data using the remaining sensors until the system detects those sensors are repaired. 

This project is coded mainly in Python. I've used a collection of different tools, such as the YOLOv3 ML algorithm, Google Collab, OpenCV, and different sensors for testing.
